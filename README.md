target-foobox
=============

A WordPress plugin to enhance the "target" menu field to a dropdown of all standard options with the addition of a "FooBox" target as well.

## Installation and Use
* Install like a normal WordPress Plugin and activate
* Activate the plugin
* Go to Appearance > Menus
* Make sure in the "Screen Options" (top right) that you've enabled "Link Target"
![Enable the Link Target field](assets/enable-link-target.png)
* Expand the menu item you customize the target for
* Choose which target you want
![Choose from the Link Target Dropdown](assets/choose-target-field.png)


## Planned Updates
* Will be adding a "Custom target" field for other plugins that use custom targets like FooBox does.
* Will be adding a custom target option for the Post/Page Editor insert link field as well.
