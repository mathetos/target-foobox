== Description ==

A WordPress plugin to enhance the "target" menu field to a dropdown of all standard options with the addition of a "FooBox" target as well.

This was originally forked from Remi Corson's "Sweet Custom Menu". The creation of his plugin is explained [here](http://wpexplorer.com/adding-custom-attributes-to-wordpress-menus)

###Planned Updates
* Will be adding a "Custom target" field for other plugins that use custom targets like FooBox does.
* Will be adding a custom target option for the Post/Page Editor insert link field as well.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. Go to Appearance > Menus
3. Make sure in the "Screen Options" (top right) that you've enabled "Link Target"
4. Expand the menu item you customize the target for
5. Choose which target you want


== Screenshots ==

1. Make sure "Link Target" is enabled.
2. Choose your target from the dropdown.
